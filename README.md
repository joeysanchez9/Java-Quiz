ABOUT THE PROJECT
The purpose of this project was to create a quiz game with a few JavaScript questions for the user to answer.  It features a timer interval that counts down from 60 seconds and user input to select the correct answer to each question.  If the answer is selected correctly, it will highlight in green, otherwise will highlight red.
